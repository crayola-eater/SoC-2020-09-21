/*
  Step 2 - Using the input to determine behavior
  Now that we have the user's input stored in a variable, we can check whether it is the correct password. If it is correct, we should then alert with some secret information.

  alert("My secret information");
  To check that our variable is equal to the correct password we can use ===, the equality operator.

  userPassword === "myPassword1!";
  The code above will resolve to true if the variable userPassword contains the string "myPassword1!".

  ðŸ‘‰ Use an if statement to alert your message only when the password is correct.

let result = prompt("Please enter the password.");
let secret = "SUPER_SECRET_PASSWORD";

if (result === secret) {
  alert(secret);
}
