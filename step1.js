/*
  Step 1 - Getting user input
  We will the using prompt to "prompt" the user for an input

  prompt("Please enter the password.");
  We hand in what we want the prompt to say as an argument, and prompt returns us what the user inputted. At the moment we are not doing anything with the return value of prompt.

  ðŸ‘‰ Use the above code, but change it so that we save the return value in a variable*.

  *to check that this step is working, console.log the variable you have made to see if it contains what you've inputted

let result = prompt("Please enter the password.");
console.log(result);
